|7.|Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int| https://github.com/sumitsawant1029/DataStructure/blob/main/Hour.c| ||minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the| ||following operations:|| ||1. Input new time|| ||2. Display the time|| ||3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the|| ||time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is|| ||set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute|| ||member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour|| ||becomes 24, it is set to zero.)||
