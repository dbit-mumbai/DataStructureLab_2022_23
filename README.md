|PROGRAM_ID |	PROGRAM DETAILS	                                                                                                                                  
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1.	      | Write a C program to check                |
|           | if a given number is Fibonacci number.	  |                                                                              
| 2.	      | Write a C program to generate Pascal      |
|           | Triangle using array.	                    |                                                                  
| 3.	      | Write a C program to roll_no, name ,      |
|           | percentange of 5 students using array     |
|           | of structure and display the records      |
|           | in ascending order of roll list.	        |
| 4.        | Write a C program to roll_no, name ,      |
|           | percentange of 5 students using array     |
|           | of structure and display the records      |
|           | in descending order of roll list.	        |
| 5.	      | Write a C program to find                 |
|           | largest element in an array               |                                                                               
| 6.	      | Write a menu driven program to perform    |
|           | the following operations in an ARRAY      | 
|           | 1. INSERT2. DELETE 3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH	|                            
| 7.	      | Define a structure data type called       |
|           | time_struct containing 3 members int hour | 
|           | int minute and int second.                |                         
|           | Write functions that accept the structure |
|           | to perform the following operations:      |                                                                  
|           | 1. Input new time	   2. Display the time	|                                                                                                             
|           | 3. Update the time such that the function |
|           |    accepts the time_struct and increments |  
|           |    time by one second.                    |
|8.         |	Write a function that compares two arrays | 
|           | returns 1 if identical and 0 otherwise.	  |                                               |
