1.	Write a C program to check if a given number is Fibonacci number.	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/Fibonacci%20Series%20(1).c
2.	Write a C program to generate Pascal Triangle using array.	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/PascalTriangle%20(1).c
3.	Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in ascending order of roll list.	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/AscendingOrder%20(1).c
4.	Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in descending order of roll list.	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/DescendingOrder%20(1).c
5.	Write a C program to find largest element in an array	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/LargestArray%20(1).c
6.	Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY 1. INSERT2. DELETE 3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/dsa1%20(1).c
7.	Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/dsa3%20(1).c
minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the	
following operations:	
1. Input new time	
2. Display the time	
3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the	
time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is	
set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute	
member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour	
becomes 24, it is set to zero.)	
8.	Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise.	https://github.com/BrightonAnthony/DSA_assignment/blob/main/dsa2%20(1).c
