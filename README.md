| 4        | Write a C program to roll\_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structureÂ  and display the records in descending order of percentange.  |
| 5        | Write a C program to find largest element in an array         |
| 6        | Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY 
1\. INSERT
2\. DELETE
3\. TRAVERSE 
4\. SEARCH |
| 7        | Define a structure data type called time\_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations:

1\. Input new time

2\. Display the time

3\. Update the time such that the function accepts the time\_struct and increments the time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.) |
| 8        | Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
