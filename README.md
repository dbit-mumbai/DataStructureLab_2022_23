## DSA experiment list A  : - 

|:---------|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------|
|1.|Write a C program to check if a given number is Fibonacci number.|https://github.com/nigelsilveira0711/DSA_Assignment/blob/441b41215984aaa142a2470a105687e31abe76fe/fibonacci.c|
|2.|Write a C program to generate Pascal Triangle using array.|https://github.com/nigelsilveira0711/DSA_Assignment/blob/1deacd10fb38feec36a574b6010835066aefb25b/pascal_triangle.c|
|3.|Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in ascending order of roll list.|https://github.com/nigelsilveira0711/DSA_Assignment/blob/f1c0345f0562d22049da62dbbeaeebab1d20fdd6/assignment_Q3.c|
|4.|Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in descending order of roll list.|https://github.com/nigelsilveira0711/DSA_Assignment/blob/05abc1cbc955984f8cd649b8e44f105d83702e9b/assignment_Q4.c|
|5.|Write a C program to find largest element in an array |https://github.com/nigelsilveira0711/DSA_Assignment/blob/5bfd39d638bab191597c7cf31d1cc853320cb93c/assignment_Q5.c|
|6.|Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY 1. INSERT2. DELETE 3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH ||
|7.|Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int| |
||minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the|
||following operations:||
||1. Input new time||
||2. Display the time||
||3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the||
||time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is||
||set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute||
||member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour||
||becomes 24, it is set to zero.)||
|8.|Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise.||
