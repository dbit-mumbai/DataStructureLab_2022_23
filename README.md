                 is Fibonacci number.
   
   2.           Write a C
                program                     https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/bed8cfed97ad7cc0c4978a320150f38cc3e0e013/PascalTriangle.c

               name , percentange of
               5 students
               using array of
               structure and
               display the 
               records in 
               ascending order
               of roll list.                


4.            Write a C program to roll_no,   https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/bfa8508baca47aebcbd57dbfcf0600f22ad5bdff/DescendingOrder.c
             name ,
             percentange of
             5 students 
             using array of
             structure and
             display the
             records in 
             descending order
             of roll list.
             
5.           Write a C program               https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/f64af454c51496728ceef5dd221dc3d482306d0c/LargestArray.c   
             to find largest             
             element in an array 
             
6.           Write a menu driven 
            program to perform              https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/b27213226d11e8f4ded177cd39189c49aba02b27/dsa1.c
            the following
            operations in
            an ARRAY 1. INSERT
            2. DELETE
            3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH
            
7.          Define a structure data
            type called time_struct                https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/d531efa8264315c841302098fbbcc3ad1bf49dae/dsa3.c
            containing 
            3 members int hour,
            int minute and 
            int second. Write
            functions that 
            accept the 
            structure to
            perform the
            following operations:
            1. Input new time
            2. Display the time
            3. Update the time 
               such that the
               function accepts
               the time_struct
               and increments the
               time by one second.
               (If the increment results 
               in 60 seconds,
               the then second member is
               set to 0 and the minute is 
               incremented by 1. 
               Then, if the result is
               60 minutes, the minute
               member is set to 0 and 
               the hour member is 
               incremented by 1. 
               Finally when the hour
               becomes 24, it is set to zero.)
               
8.             Write a function 
               that compares two                          https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/84255877a5663ce603338d083639e66f94d85fc4/dsa2.c
               arrays and returns
               1 if they are identical 
               and 0 otherwise.
