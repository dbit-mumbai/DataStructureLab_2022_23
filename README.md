   1.          	Write a C program                     
                  to check                           https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/e1bc54889a1d84ac924492ed1c4aa36398ad4a90/FibonacciSeries.c
                 if a given number
                 is Fibonacci number.
   
   2.           Write a C
                program                     https://github.com/violanoronha/dsasubmissions/blob/bed8cfed97ad7cc0c4978a320150f38cc3e0e013/PascalTriangle.c
                to generate
                Pascal Triangle               
                using array.
                
   3.          Write a C program to roll_no,
               name , percentange of
               5 students
               using array of
               structure and
               display the 
               records in 
               ascending order
               of roll list.                


4.            Write a C program to roll_no,
             name ,
             percentange of
             5 students 
             using array of
             structure and
             display the
             records in 
             descending order
             of roll list.
             
5.           Write a C program 
             to find largest
             element in an array 
             
6.           Write a menu driven 
            program to perform
            the following
            operations in
            an ARRAY 1. INSERT
            2. DELETE
            3. TRAVERSE 4. SEARCH
            
7.          Define a structure data
            type called time_struct
            containing 
            3 members int hour,
            int minute and 
            int second. Write
            functions that 
            accept the 
            structure to
            perform the
            following operations:
            1. Input new time
            2. Display the time
            3. Update the time 
               such that the
               function accepts
               the time_struct
               and increments the
               time by one second.
               (If the increment results 
               in 60 seconds,
               the then second member is
               set to 0 and the minute is 
               incremented by 1. 
               Then, if the result is
               60 minutes, the minute
               member is set to 0 and 
               the hour member is 
               incremented by 1. 
               Finally when the hour
               becomes 24, it is set to zero.)
               
8.             Write a function 
               that compares two
               arrays and returns
               1 if they are identical 
               and 0 otherwise.
