| 6 |Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an array:1.INSERT, 2.DELETE, 3.TRAVERSE, 4.SEARCH | [array1.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/array1.c) |
| 7 |Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations: 1. Input new time, 2.Display the time, 3.Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.) | [time.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/time.c) |
| 8 |Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise. | [array_ops.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/array_ops.c) |
