DSA EXP A
##Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int
minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the
following operations:
1. Input new time
2. Display the time
3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the
time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is
set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute
member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour
becomes 24, it is set to zero.)

#include <stdio.h>
struct time
{
int hour;
int minutes;
int seconds;
};

int main (void)
{
struct time timeUpdate (struct time now);
struct time currentTime, nextTime;

printf ("Enter the time (hh:mm:ss): ");
scanf ("%i:%i:%i", &currentTime.hour,
&currentTime.minutes, &currentTime.seconds);
nextTime = timeUpdate (currentTime);

printf ("Updated time is %.2i:%.2i:%.2i\n", nextTime.hour,
nextTime.minutes, nextTime.seconds );

return 0;
}
// Function to update the time by one second
struct time timeUpdate (struct time now)
{ 

if ( now.seconds >= 60 ) { // next minute

now.seconds = 0;
    ++now.minutes;}
if (now.minutes >= 60) { // next hour

now.minutes = 0;
    ++now.hour;}
if ( now.hour >= 24 ){// midnight
now.hour = 0;

}
return now;
}
